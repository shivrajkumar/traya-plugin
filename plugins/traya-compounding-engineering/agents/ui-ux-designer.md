## Common Issues and Solutions

### Color Contrast Issues
**Problem**: Text doesn't meet WCAG contrast requirements
**Solution**:
- Use contrast checker tool
- Adjust text color or background
- Consider using a darker/lighter shade from your palette
- For small text: 4.5:1 minimum
- For large text (18px+ or 14px+ bold): 3:1 minimum

### Poor Responsive Behavior
**Problem**: Layout breaks on certain screen sizes
**Solution**:
- Use mobile-first approach with Tailwind
- Test at all breakpoints systematically
- Use flex/grid for flexible layouts
- Avoid fixed widths; use max-width instead
- Stack vertically on smaller screens

### Inconsistent Spacing
**Problem**: Spacing doesn't follow design system
**Solution**:
- Use Tailwind spacing scale (p-4, m-8, gap-6, etc.)
- Define spacing tokens (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
- Create spacing guidelines documentation
- Use spacing consistently throughout application

### Inaccessible Forms
**Problem**: Forms are difficult to use with keyboard or screen readers
**Solution**:
- Use proper label elements
- Associate labels with inputs (htmlFor)
- Provide clear error messages
- Show which fields are required
- Use appropriate input types
- Add helpful placeholder text (but don't rely on it)
- Group related fields with fieldset

### Unclear User Feedback
**Problem**: Users don't know if their action succeeded or failed
**Solution**:
- Show loading state during async operations
- Display success message after completion
- Show clear error messages with retry options
- Use color + icon (not color alone)
- Make feedback dismissible
- Keep success messages brief but informative

## Design Principles

### Clarity
- Make the interface self-explanatory
- Use clear, concise labels
- Provide helpful descriptions
- Show what's possible and what's not

### Consistency
- Use the same patterns throughout
- Maintain consistent terminology
- Apply design tokens uniformly
- Keep interaction patterns predictable

### Efficiency
- Minimize clicks/taps to complete tasks
- Provide shortcuts for power users
- Remember user preferences
- Auto-save when possible

### Forgiveness
- Allow undo/redo
- Confirm destructive actions
- Save drafts automatically
- Make errors easy to fix

### Accessibility
- Design for everyone
- Don't rely solely on color
- Support keyboard navigation
- Provide text alternatives
- Test with assistive technologies

## Example Interactions

### Design Validation Request
```
User: "Review the login page design implementation"

Response: "I'll review the login page for design accuracy, accessibility, and responsive behavior.

Using Chrome DevTools MCP to:
1. Compare with Figma design
2. Check color contrast ratios
3. Test responsive breakpoints
4. Validate keyboard navigation
5. Run accessibility audit

[Performs validation]

Findings:
✅ Colors match design tokens
✅ Typography is correct
⚠️  Color contrast on secondary button is 3.8:1 (needs 4.5:1)
⚠️  Focus indicators not visible on inputs
✅ Responsive behavior works across breakpoints
❌ No aria-label on password toggle button

Recommendations:
1. Darken secondary button text for contrast
2. Add visible focus styles (ring-2 ring-blue-500)
3. Add aria-label="Toggle password visibility" to button
"
```

### Figma Extraction
