# Create GitHub Issue

## Introduction

Transform feature descriptions, bug reports, or improvement ideas into well-structured markdown files issues that follow project conventions and best practices. This command provides flexible detail levels to match your needs.

## Feature Description

<feature_description> #$ARGUMENTS </feature_description>

## Main Tasks

### 1. Repository Research & Context Gathering

<thinking>
First, I need to understand the project's conventions and existing patterns, leveraging all available resources and use paralel subagents to do this.
</thinking>

Runn these three agents in paralel at the same time:

- Task repo-research-analyst(feature_description)
- Task best-practices-researcher (feature_description)
- Task framework-docs-researcher (feature_description)

**Reference Collection:**

- [ ] Document all research findings with specific file paths (e.g., `app/services/example_service.rb:42`)
- [ ] Include URLs to external documentation and best practices guides
- [ ] Create a reference list of similar issues or PRs (e.g., `#123`, `#456`)
- [ ] Note any team conventions discovered in `CLAUDE.md` or team documentation

### 2. Issue Planning & Structure

<thinking>
Think like a product manager - what would make this issue clear and actionable? Consider multiple perspectives
</thinking>

**Title & Categorization:**

- [ ] Draft clear, searchable issue title using conventional format (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)
- [ ] Identify appropriate labels from repository's label set (`gh label list`)
- [ ] Determine issue type: enhancement, bug, refactor

**Stakeholder Analysis:**

- [ ] Identify who will be affected by this issue (end users, developers, operations)
- [ ] Consider implementation complexity and required expertise

**Content Planning:**

- [ ] Choose appropriate detail level based on issue complexity and audience
- [ ] List all necessary sections for the chosen template
- [ ] Gather supporting materials (error logs, screenshots, design mockups)
- [ ] Prepare code examples or reproduction steps if applicable, name the mock filenames in the lists

### 3. Choose Implementation Detail Level

Select how comprehensive you want the issue to be:

#### üìÑ MINIMAL (Quick Issue)

**Best for:** Simple bugs, small improvements, clear features

**Includes:**

- Problem statement or feature description
- Basic acceptance criteria
- Essential context only

**Structure:**

````markdown

## MVP

### test.rb

```ruby
class Test
  def initialize
    @name = "test"
  end
end
```

## References

- Related issue: #[issue_number]
- Documentation: [relevant_docs_url]
````

```

### 4. Issue Creation & Formatting

<thinking>
Apply best practices for clarity and actionability, making the issue easy to scan and understand
</thinking>

**Content Formatting:**

- [ ] Use clear, descriptive headings with proper hierarchy (##, ###)
- [ ] Include code examples in triple backticks with language syntax highlighting
- [ ] Add screenshots/mockups if UI-related (drag & drop or use image hosting)
- [ ] Use task lists (- [ ]) for trackable items that can be checked off
- [ ] Add collapsible sections for lengthy logs or optional details using `<details>` tags
- [ ] Apply appropriate emoji for visual scanning (üêõ bug, ‚ú® feature, üìö docs, ‚ôªÔ∏è refactor)

**Cross-Referencing:**

- [ ] Link to related issues/PRs using #number format
- [ ] Reference specific commits with SHA hashes when relevant
- [ ] Link to code using GitHub's permalink feature (press 'y' for permanent link)
- [ ] Mention relevant team members with @username if needed
- [ ] Add links to external resources with descriptive text

**Code & Examples:**

```markdown
# Good example with syntax highlighting and line references

\`\`\`ruby

# app/services/user_service.rb:42

def process_user(user)

# Implementation here

end \`\`\`

# Collapsible error logs

<details>
<summary>Full error stacktrace</summary>

\`\`\` Error details here... \`\`\`

</details>
```

**AI-Era Considerations:**

- [ ] Account for accelerated development with AI pair programming
- [ ] Include prompts or instructions that worked well during research
- [ ] Note which AI tools were used for initial exploration (Claude, Copilot, etc.)
- [ ] Emphasize comprehensive testing given rapid implementation
- [ ] Document any AI-generated code that needs human review

### 5. Final Review & Submission

**Pre-submission Checklist:**

- [ ] Title is searchable and descriptive
- [ ] Labels accurately categorize the issue
- [ ] All template sections are complete
- [ ] Links and references are working
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable
- [ ] Add names of files in pseudo code examples and todo lists
- [ ] Add an ERD mermaid diagram if applicable for new model changes

## Output Format

Present the complete issue content within `<github_issue>` tags, ready for GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh issue create --title "[TITLE]" --body "[CONTENT]" --label "[LABELS]"
```

## Thinking Approaches

- **Analytical:** Break down complex features into manageable components
- **User-Centric:** Consider end-user impact and experience
- **Technical:** Evaluate implementation complexity and architecture fit
- **Strategic:** Align with project goals and roadmap
