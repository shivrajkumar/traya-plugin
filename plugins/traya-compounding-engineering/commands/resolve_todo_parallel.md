Resolve all TODO comments using parallel processing.

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze

Get all unresolved TODOs from the /todos/\*.md directory

### 2. Plan

Create a TodoWrite list of all unresolved items grouped by type.Make sure to look at dependencies that might occur and prioritize the ones needed by others. For example, if you need to change a name, you must wait to do the others. Output a mermaid flow diagram showing how we can do this. Can we do everything in parallel? Do we need to do one first that leads to others in parallel? I'll put the to-dos in the mermaid diagram flowâ€‘wise so the agent knows how to proceed in order.

### 3. Implement (PARALLEL)

Spawn a pr-comment-resolver agent for each unresolved item in parallel.

So if there are 3 comments, it will spawn 3 pr-comment-resolver agents in parallel. liek this

1. Task pr-comment-resolver(comment1)
2. Task pr-comment-resolver(comment2)
3. Task pr-comment-resolver(comment3)

Always run all in parallel subagents/Tasks for each Todo item.

### 4. Commit & Resolve

- Commit changes
- Remove the TODO from the file, and mark it as resolved.
- Push to remote
