# Work Plan Execution Command

## Introduction

This command helps you analyze a work document (plan, Markdown file, specification, or any structured document), create a comprehensive todo list using the TodoWrite tool, and then systematically execute each task until the entire plan is completed. It combines deep analysis with practical execution to transform plans into reality.

## Prerequisites

- A work document to analyze (plan file, specification, or any structured document)
- Clear understanding of project context and goals
- Access to necessary tools and permissions for implementation
- Ability to test and validate completed work
- Git repository with main branch

## Main Tasks

### 1. Setup Development Environment

- Ensure main branch is up to date
- Create feature branch with descriptive name
- Setup worktree for isolated development
- Configure development environment

### 2. Analyze Input Document

<input_document> #$ARGUMENTS </input_document>

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Environment Setup

1. **Update Main Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create Feature Branch and Worktree**

   - Determine appropriate branch name from document
   - Get the root directory of the Git repository:

   ```bash
   git_root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   ```

   - Create worktrees directory if it doesn't exist:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p "$git_root/.worktrees"
   ```

   - Add .worktrees to .gitignore if not already there:

   ```bash
   if ! grep -q "^\.worktrees$" "$git_root/.gitignore"; then
     echo ".worktrees" >> "$git_root/.gitignore"
   fi
   ```

   - Create the new worktree with feature branch:

   ```bash
   git worktree add -b feature-branch-name "$git_root/.worktrees/feature-branch-name" main
   ```

   - Change to the new worktree directory:

   ```bash
   cd "$git_root/.worktrees/feature-branch-name"
   ```

3. **Verify Environment**
   - Confirm in correct worktree directory
   - Install dependencies if needed
   - Run initial tests to ensure clean state

### Phase 2: Document Analysis and Planning

1. **Read Input Document**

   - Use Read tool to examine the work document
   - Identify all deliverables and requirements
   - Note any constraints or dependencies
   - Extract success criteria

2. **Create Task Breakdown**

   - Convert requirements into specific tasks
   - Add implementation details for each task
   - Include testing and validation steps
   - Consider edge cases and error handling

3. **Build Todo List**
   - Use TodoWrite to create comprehensive list
   - Set priorities based on dependencies
   - Include all subtasks and checkpoints
   - Add documentation and review tasks

### Phase 3: Systematic Execution

1. **Task Execution Loop**

   ```
   while (tasks remain):
     - Select next task (priority + dependencies)
     - Mark as in_progress
     - Execute task completely
     - Validate completion
     - Mark as completed
     - Update progress
   ```

2. **Quality Assurance**

   - Run tests after each task
   - Execute lint and typecheck commands
   - Verify no regressions
   - Check against acceptance criteria
   - Document any issues found

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Regularly update task status
   - Note any blockers or delays
   - Create new tasks for discoveries
   - Maintain work visibility

### Phase 4: Completion and Submission

1. **Final Validation**

   - Verify all tasks completed
   - Run comprehensive test suite
   - Execute final lint and typecheck
   - Check all deliverables present
   - Ensure documentation updated

2. **Prepare for Submission**

   - Stage and commit all changes
   - Write commit messages
   - Push feature branch to remote
   - Create detailed pull request

3. **Create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature-branch-name
   gh pr create --title "Feature: [Description]" --body "[Detailed description]"
   ```
